# Exercise: JavaScript Array Functions

> This exercise has been created by me, but obviously is a common problem that you can find in other places. In `main.go` you can find my solution.

Replicate the functionality of `map` and `filter` js array functions, but execute them concurrently. Note that the returned array must have the same order as introduced.
